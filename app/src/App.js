            What you say, what you hear, what you see define your emotions.
            Every combination of words and thoughts, sounds and visuals translate into a unique vibe.
            This is why music producer Gusku and Selas Studio have partnered to develop a collection of NFTs to attach music to unique semantics: generated visuals, generated with artificial intelligence.

            Solana is a Proof of Stake blockchain on which the Cosmic Kid Collection will be stored and exchanged. Blockchain unicity and traceability will empower the Cosmic Kid community to hold and trade IP rights on Gusku's track ‚ÄúRolling Under The Wave‚Äù, without requiring any third party approval, and potentially giving access to way more: exclusive access to a venue, a boat or any other physical space, specific privileges, etc. On top of their holding rights, every Cosmic Kid will be an artistic proof of your attendance to the party, your curiosity and love for innovation in Arts.

          Gusku has been producing music for more than 10 years, from his little studio next to the Flandrin. Gusku is a perfectionist, he likes to produce music way more than mixing other peoples‚Äô sounds, even if he dropped some bombs in Marrakech last year, he is a music maker above all things. This is why he would like to give to the Cosmic Kids community the ownership of his exclusive track: ‚ÄúRolling Under the Wave‚Äù. Each holder being entitled to its fraction of revenue on the track.

          Hugo has been recently investigating the web3 space, as an innovation, party and music lover, just out of curiosity. He wonders if this can be used for artists to break labels' walls, get their independence partnering with their fanbase. He also wonders if clubs and festivals will eventually use it as improved versions of members cards to reward their fidelity with exclusive rights.
